# Personal Blog / Website
Personal website for Assignment 3


### Overview

This website is not a professional resume per se, rather, it is more of a personal blog or informal portfolio for details on my three passions (Cooking/Food, Technology/Computer Science, and Music/Composition). 
The website includes the following elements: Navigation panel for quicker access amongst categories as well as links to my profiles for different platforms, overview/biography header, gallery for photos related to passions, drawing/picture of me as the favicon, 3 sections/1 for each passion, each section divided into descriptions/technicals.
